List of common key bindings.  All definitions are stored at:

	~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
	~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc_bspc

The latter is for definitions that control the window manager.  While
the former has WM-independent keys.

Explanation of the basics
=========================

The Super key, aka "mod4", is the one that most keyboards mark with the
Windows logo.  While the key "Return" is also known as "Enter".

Motions are the same as Vim: h,j,k,l (left,down,up,right).

This is the general format of a key chord (aka key binding):

	Super + <key>

And this is a key chord chain:

	Super + <key> ; <key>

The keys "Super", "Alt", "Shift", "Ctrl" are known as "modifiers".

To run a key chord, hold down the modifier and press the key.  Key chord
chains build on that principle: you type the key binding to the left of
the semicolon (;), release the modifier and then type the key (or key
chord) to the right of the semicolon.

In this document, the notation {h,j,k,l} means "any one among" the
comma-separated items.  Whereas {1-4} denotes a range: 1,2,3,4.

Getting started
===============

Super + Return            |-Open a terminal running the "Default" tmux session
Super + Shift + Return    |-Open a generic, yet fully-capable terminal (xterm)
Super + q                 |-Close focused window safely (apps might require confirmation)
Super + Shift + q         |-Kill focused window (no confirmation whatsoever)
Ctrl + Alt + Delete       |-Launch poweroptionsmenu, where you can choose to log out, reboot, etc.

Window motions
==============

Super + {h,j,k,l}         |-Move focus in the given direction == choose which window has attention
Super + Shift + {h,j,k,l} |-Swap focused node with the one in the given direction
Super + Ctrl + {h,j,k,l}  |-Expand/contract tiled node in that direction, provided there is a split
Super + Alt + {h,j,k,l}   |-Set preselection (manual tiling) for next window
                          |---Cancel presel by inputting same command again
Super + Alt + {1-9}       |-Set the presel ratio, relative to the focused node
Super + Shift + <arrows>  |-Move floating window
Alt + right click         |-Drag floating window
Alt + left click          |-Resize floating window from the nearest edge

Window and desktop actions
==========================

Super + Space             |-Toggle between tiled and floating states
Super + m                 |-Toggle between tiled and monocle layout (monocle == maximised nodes)
Super + f                 |-Toggle focused window's full screen view
Alt + Tab                 |-Cycle through windows on the current desktop
Alt + Shift + Tab         |-Cycle backwardly through windows on the current desktop

Desktop operations
==================

Super + {0-9}             |-Switch to the designated desktop (workspace)
Super + Shift + {0-9}     |-Send focused node to the given desktop
                          |---Desktops are created/removed dynamically (my custom setup)
Super + Tab               |-Cycle through desktops on the current monitor
Super + Shift + Tab       |-Cycle backwardly through desktops on the current monitor
Super + r                 |-Rotate the node tree 90 degrees clockwise
Super + Shift + r         |-Rotate the node tree 90 degrees counter-clockwise
Super + Alt + r           |-Mirror/flip the node tree (top left becomes bottom right)
Super + s ; {b,e}         |-Balance or equalise node splits (better try it to get an idea)
                          |---Balance works on the parent node.  Equalise is for all nodes.
Super + Shift + {[,]}     |-Incrementally decrease or increase the gaps between the tiled nodes
Super + Shift + {y,u,i,o} |-Change to gap presents {0,5,10,20}
Super + comma             |-Switch focus to the next monitor (cycles through monitors)
Super + Shift + comma     |-Switch focus to the previous monitor (cycles through monitors)

Launching programs
==================

Super + d                 |-Run dmenu with access to all binaries in PATH
Super + Shift + d         |-Run flatpakmenu with access to all flatpak apps
Super + g ; {1-3}         |-Open graphical apps {firefox,caja,thunderbird}
Super + x ; 0             |-Launch a floating terminal running calc

Useful extras
=============

Super + {F1,Home}         |-Launch a floating window with this cheat sheet
Print                     |-Get a screenshot of the focused window saved to the ~/Desktop
Super + Print             |-Get a screenshot of the entire viewport saved to the ~/Desktop
Super + p                 |-Run passmenu to copy a password stored with the UNIX tool "pass"
Super + x ; w             |-Run a floating image browser, from where you can also set the wallpaper
Super + e ; c             |-Toggle the display compotisor (do this if you have performance issues)
Super + e ; f             |-Toggle BSPWM "focus mode", to remove gaps, the padding, the panel
Super + e ; t             |-Run tempusmenu to select a Tempus theme for a live theme switch
                          |---The Tempus themes: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/tempus-themes
                          |---Some ports of the Tempus themes are distributed with my dotfiles

Further reading
===============

Study the ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc and ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc_bspc.
They are extensively documented.  You will find key chords for tasks not
included herein, such as multimedia keys, setting node flags, and more.
