# `Polybar`` config 
The `poolybar` config used for this `bspwm` config is on
separate repo 
`https/gitlab.com/smikeya/polybars-smike`
  To install it follow instructions on that repo.

 2. On this repo you can find my `old polybar config` which is based 
    on `Derec Teilor` aka dt config and you can try it.
