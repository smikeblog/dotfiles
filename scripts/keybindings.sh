	List of some useful keybindings.
	More can be found from the file ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc.
	You can also edit keybindings there.

	Mod4 is super key, on many keyboards marked with windows logo.
	As a rule of thumb, super+<direction> moves focus,
	super+shift+<direction> moves focused window,
	and super+ctrl+<direction> resizes windows.

	Arrow keys, wasd and hjkl represent directions and numbers represent
	different workspaces.
